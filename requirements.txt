#Overview and basic requirements to implement our codes:

##Language and recommended version: Python 3 or higher

##Packages:
from pyemd import emd
import math
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
from scipy.stats import binom
from scipy.stats import poisson
from scipy.stats import wasserstein_distance
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

##Downloading the dataset
The Gowalla check-ins dataset should be downloaded from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html and prepared as follows:
1. Download the .gz file named "loc-gowalla_totalCheckins.txt.gz" from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html. 
2. Gunzip the file and rename the gunzipped .txt file as "gowalla_checkin.txt".

##Refer to the README.md file for a detailed and step-by-step overview of the implementation process.  

##The codes provided mostly generate the .csv files for the output data of the different experiments. All the visualisations provided in the paper were done using an external (paid) software called GraphPad PRISM using those output datasets. If one wishes to reproduce the plots, they may use any visualisation software or packages from Python that help to plot the output data from the .csv files produced by the codes.
